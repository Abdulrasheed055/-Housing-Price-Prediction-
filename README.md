# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📘 Project Overview

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices based on key features such as area, number of rooms, and location. It demonstrates how **machine learning** can be used for **data-driven real estate insights** — enabling better pricing strategies and decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To build a **predictive model** that estimates house prices using **Linear Regression**, leveraging exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling for accurate and interpretable predictions.

---

## ⚙️ Process and Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

* Collected a housing dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or an open data source).
* Imported data using **Pandas** for analysis and preprocessing.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Handled **missing values** using imputation or removal.
* Encoded **categorical features** (like location) using One-Hot or Label Encoding.
* Performed **feature scaling** using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
* Removed **outliers** to reduce noise and improve model stability.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization.
* Analyzed distributions, correlations, and key relationships between features.
* Identified strong positive relationships between house prices and features like area and number of rooms.

### 4️⃣ Model Building

* Implemented **Linear Regression** using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
* Split dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
* Trained model to predict housing prices.

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using metrics such as:

* **R² Score** – measures goodness of fit.
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – measures average prediction error.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – penalizes large errors.

### 6️⃣ Prediction & Visualization

* Predicted house prices on test data.
* Visualized **Actual vs. Predicted Prices** to evaluate performance.

## 📊 Insights

* **Area and location** were the most influential features.
* **Data normalization and outlier removal** improved accuracy.
* **Linear Regression** effectively captured linear trends but was limited for non-linear data.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

* Experiment with **Ridge**, **Lasso**, or **ElasticNet** for regularization.
* Try **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** for non-linear relationships.
* Deploy the model using **Streamlit** or **Flask** for interactive price predictions.
* Periodically retrain the model with new data to maintain relevance.

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python** 🐍
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**

---

## 🚀 Results

* Achieved a high **R² score**, showing a strong relationship between input features and predicted prices.
* Delivered a reliable baseline model for real estate price forecasting.
